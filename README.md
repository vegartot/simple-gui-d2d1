# A simple graphics application written in C++ using Direct2D.

The project is a personal educational project intended to familiarize myself with the WIN32 and Direct2D API.  
Feel free to look at the source, and/or use it in your own projects. Code is intended to work as is, thus expendabliity  
and optimizations have not been highly considered.

**THE GOAL**:  
To create a working graphicsal Tic-Tac-Toe application where the user plays against the computer.  
The application should include a head-to-head score and a reset button to reset all scores.
